# Graph search algorithm implementations on mazes

> Development has ended

This is the code that was part of my submission for the module Artificial Intelligence and Applications taught by Prof. Ayah Helal. It is a Python program that converts supplied text mazes into graphs and applies either a breadth-first search or a depth-first search to find a solution to the maze and then outputs the solution in text format to the terminal.

## Installation

Nothing to install, run with Python 3.x. Code doesn't require any libraries that aren't part of the Python Standard Library.

## Usage

The search algorithms can be run on the provided mazes, or you can create and supply your own and give their path when requested. To create a maze use a .txt file where the maze walls are indicated with '#' and the empty spaces with '-'. Ensure there is a complete border of walls with an entrance somewhere on the first line and an exit somewhere on the last line.
